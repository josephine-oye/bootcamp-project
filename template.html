    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Abstract Art</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This Processing project demonstrates a some understanding 
	of the use of objects, classes, and randomness. I adapted the bouncing ball program, for it to have a line between the balls. I also add a stop(press Q for quit) and start(press R for resume) button which allows the user to interact with the programme and stop it when they like what they see. I used randomness for the colours that the balls and the line are, and set the colour range in a particular way so that all the colours had the same tint.
